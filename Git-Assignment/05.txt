In this exercise, you are one of a team of developers. Your team uses feature branches to manage changes. You have been asked to make a change to the train-schedule app. Instead of the app's main page header reading "Train Schedule," the customer wants it to read “Find your train!” or vice-versa (You may find the text the reverse of what is said so please do the reverse). This text can be found in the project file views/index.jade, and you're going to have to change it.

Prerequisites:

A GitHub.com account
In order to push a change to the code, you will need to:

Install git
Configure git for ssh authentication with GitHub.com
Create a personal fork of the sample repository https://github.com/satyensingh/train-schedule-app.git
Clone your personal fork from GitHub
Create a feature branch to contain the change
Change the header text in views/index.jade from “Train Schedule” to “Find your train!”
Add the change in views/index.jade to the next commit
Commit the change
Push the change to the remote scm repository
Create a pull request to merge the feature branch into the master branch
Merge the pull request
