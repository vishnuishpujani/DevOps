We are going to use nested functions to simulate the kind of abstraction you find in many object oriented languages. Create the following structures in your script:

a function that defines two local variables to hole the number of arms and legs that a human being has.
nested functions, one for each a male and female, that contain the appropriate number of beards that each gender has.
capture the gender as a command line parameter.
test the command line parameter and call the appropriate functions in order to display the characteristics of the indicated gender.
