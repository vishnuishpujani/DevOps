Create a script that interacts with the user. Prompt them to guess a secret number between 1 and 5. Read the guess from the terminal and assign it to a variable. Using the 'if' statement from the course, test that value to determine if they guessed the right number (you choose the correct value). If they do, display a success message, otherwise do nothing.

#!/bin/bash

read -p "Guess a secret number between 1 and 5: " GUESS

if [ $GUESS == 4 ]
then
  echo "You guessed it right!"
