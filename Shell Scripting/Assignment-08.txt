Create a script that interacts with the user. You will want to prompt the user to enter the following information (which you will capture and place into the following variables):

FIRSTNAME
LASTNAME
USERAGE

Greet the user with their name and current age displayed and then calculate and display their age in 10 years.


#!/bin/bash

read -p "Enter your First Name: " FIRSTNAME
read -p "Enter your Last Name: " LASTNAME
read -p "Enter your age: " USERAGE

echo "Hello, $FIRSTNAME $LASTNAME!"
PLUSTEN=`expr $USERAGE + 10`
echo "You are $USERAGE years old now. You'll be $PLUSTEN years old in 10 years."
