Write a script that will prompt the user to enter a number between 1 and 3. Capture that number in a variable and then test that variable. Be sure to display the variable and it's value as appropriate within an if/then/else statement where the final statement will display if they did not enter a number between 1 and 3 telling them they failed to follow instructions. Redirect errors from each of the tests to /dev/null (to prevent script errors from showing if text is entered for example).
