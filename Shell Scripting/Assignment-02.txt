Write a script that sets FOUR variables:

MYUSERNAME
MYPASSWORD
STARTOFSCRIPT
ENDOFSCRIPT

Populate the first two with some default value and use command redirection to set the third and fourth value to the date/time of when the script was started and completed. Within the script, be sure to display the values to the terminal when run.

#!/bin/bash
MYUSERNAME="vishnu"
MYPASSWORD="vishnu123"
STARTOFSCRIPT=$(date)
echo "Script started at $STARTOFSCRIPT"
echo "USERNAME: $MYUSERNAME"
echo "PASSWORD: $MYPASSWORD"
ENDOFSCRIPT=$(date)
echo "Script ended at $ENDOFSCRIPT"
