In this script, we will be using an Input Box constructed from the dialog control, to prompt the user for a filename to display to the terminal. Construct the input box within a function and capture the value input using the appropriate output method to a file. Read that file back in and attempt to display (cat) the file to the terminal or indicate that it does not exist.
