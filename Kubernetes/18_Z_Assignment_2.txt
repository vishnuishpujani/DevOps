Learning Objectives:-
Create the cron job in the cluster
Allow the cron job to run successfully

Problem Statement:-
Your company has a simple data cleanup process that is run periodically for maintenance purposes. They would like to stop doing this manually in order to save time, so you have been asked to implement a cron job in the Kubernetes cluster to run this process. Create a cron job called cleanup-cronjob using the linuxacademycontent/data-cleanup:1 image. Have the job run every minute with the following cron expression: */1 * * * *.


apiVersion: batch/v1beta1
kind: CronJob
metadata:
  name: cronjob
spec:
  schedule: "*/1 * * * *"

          containers:
          - name: cronjob
            image: linuxacademycontent/data-cleanup:1
            args:
            - /bin/sh
            - -c
            - date; echo Hello from the Kubernetes cluster
          restartPolicy: OnFailure
