Learning Objectives:-
Perform a rolling update of the container version
Roll back to the previous working state


Problem Statement:-
Your company's developers have just finished developing a new version of their candy-themed mobile game. They are ready to update the backend services that are running in your Kubernetes cluster. There is a deployment in the cluster managing the replicas for this application. The deployment is called candy-deployment. 

candy-deployment.yaml
--------------------------



You have been asked to update the image for the container named candy-ws in this deployment template to a new version, linuxacademycontent/candy-service:3.
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: candy-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: candy-ws
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: candy-ws
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: linuxacademycontent/candy-service:2
        name: candy-ws
After you have updated the image using a rolling update, check on the status of the update to make sure it is working. If it is not working, perform a rollback to the previous state.

Make sure that the rolling update is in such a way that atleast 25% of pods are up and running during update with Zero downtime.


kubectl apply -f candy-deployment.yaml --record=true
kubectl rollout status deployment candy-deployment

After that changed version in yaml and added strategy:

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: candy-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 2  
strategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
    rollingUpdate:
      maxSurge: 25%
      maxUnavailable: 25% 
   selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: candy-ws
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: candy-ws
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: linuxacademycontent/candy-service:3
        name: candy-ws
		
kubectl apply -f candy-deployment.yaml --record=true
kubectl rollout status deployment candy-deployment
kubectl rollout history deployment candy-deployment
if it rolling update fails:

kubectl rollout undo deployment candy-deployment
