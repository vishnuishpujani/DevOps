echo $HISTSIZE increase history size

Display all the commands entered so far, now, try to run a particular command from the history list without typing that command. history
fc -s commandnumber

NOTE:- TAB key is your friend when it comes to command completion and having long file and directory names autocompleted at the bash prompt for you. JUST BE LAZY AND USE TAB KEY FOR AUTO COMPLETION ;-)
